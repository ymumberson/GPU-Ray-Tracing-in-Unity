# GPU-Ray-Tracing-in-Unity
Currently follows a tutorial found at: http://blog.three-eyed-games.com/2018/05/03/gpu-ray-tracing-in-unity-part-1/

Later, I intend to add the features from Sebastian Lague in: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz0KTGYJtUk&t=196s

The aim of this project is to develop my understanding of Compute Shaders in Unity. Compute Shaders allow you to run code on the GPU, so they are very efficient for simulations which tend to be highly parallelisable by nature, however, they require rewriting your code to make in compatible with HLSL which can be difficult.

Currently the images look like this:
